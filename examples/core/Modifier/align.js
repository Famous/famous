/**
 * Modifier with align
 * --------------------
 * Modifiers have an `align` property. This property controls the
 * position of the modifier's children in the render tree. Its
 * default value, `[0, 0]`, places the modifier's render node at
 * the top left of its parent.
 * 
 * Size and alignment work together to determine the position of
 * render nodes. Consider a render node with an alignment of `[1, 1]`
 * (bottom right). As its parent node's size changes, its position
 * on the screen will change. This diagram explains the effect:
 * 
 *     +--+    +----+
 *     |  | => |    |
 *     | *|    |    |
 *     +--+    |   *|
 *             +----+
 * 
 * In the example below, nine surfaces are placed inside of a Famo.us
 * context. By changing their alignment, we can lay them out at key
 * positions within their sizing context. (Note that by default, the
 * context's size is the size of the window.)
 *
