/**
 * Quaternion
 * ----------
 * 
 * Quaternions are used to represent rotations.  It has two components,
 * an axis represented by x, y, and z and the amount of rotation to
 * be applied around that axis, represented by w.  Quaternions are
 * particularly useful because they have no chance of gimbal lock.
 *
 * In this example, we have a Quaternion that defined the surface's
 * rotation.
