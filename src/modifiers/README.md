==================================

Implementations of the core/Modifier pattern which output transforms to the
render tree.

- Fader.js: Modifier that allows you to fade the opacity of affected renderables in and out.
- ModifierChain.js: A class to add and remove a chain of modifiers at a single
  point in the render tree.
- StateModifier.js: A collection of visual changes to be applied to another
  renderable component, strongly coupled with the state that defines those
  changes.
