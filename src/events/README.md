Events: Famous eventing libraries
=================================

Events are used for communication between objects in Famous.  Famo.us implements
an event interface similar to that used in NodeJS.


## Files

- EventArbiter.js: A switch which wraps several event destinations and redirects
  received events to at most one of them.
- EventFilter.js: EventFilter regulates the broadcasting of events based on a
  specified condition.
- EventMapper.js: EventMapper routes events to various event destinations based
  on custom logic.
