Famo.us
=======


Famo.us provides a powerful JavaScript framework and developer tools designed to build rich, fast web applications.  Famo.us takes an opinionated approach to developing with web technology, maintaining tight control of rendering to achieve maximum UI performance.  Built-in and user-defined animations can be powered by our physics engine, creating delightful, natural motion.  The framework also maintains strict modularity for maximum flexibility.  Paired with server-side technology designed to match Famo.us on the front end, you can finally create high quality applications that were once reserved only for native development.

The Famo.us front end is currently optimized to work for mobile devices on iOS (6 and above) and Android (4.3 and above).  Broader support for more browsers is coming.

Our [github organization][famous-organization-github] is primarily for those wishing to contribute back to Famo.us.  If you are looking instead to get started quickly on an applications and you've only cloned this repository, prefer one of the installation methods listed in the Installation section.

Famous is currently in public beta.  Expect additions and changes to be rapid during this early period.

## Famous.git package

This package contains the submodules necessary to be productive in Famo.us.  They are all hosted on [our github organization][famous-organization-github].  

Cloning this repo will give you a famous folder, but all subfolders will be unpopulated unless you initialize and update your submodules. To clone and update from the command line, run

```
git clone git@github.com:Famous/famous.git
cd famous
git submodule update --init
```

This will populate the following submodules:

| Submodule | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| core | The low level componentry of Famo.us, plus the required famous.css stylesheet. |
| events | Events are used for communication between objects in Famous. |
| inputs | The inputs library is used to interpret user input to the device. |
| math | A simple math library used throughout the core. |
| modifiers | Implementations of the core/Modifier pattern which output transforms to the render tree. |
| physics | Core engine controlling animations via physical simulation. |
| surfaces | Surfaces extend core/Surface and encapsulate common HTML tags like `<img>` and `<canvas>`.|
| transitions | Transitions are used to create animation, usually by providing input to a Modifier. |
| utilities | Utilities hosts various helper classes and static methods. |
| views | Views are visually interactable components for use in applications. |
| widgets | Widgets are small visually interactable components for use in applications with their own styling. |
